// A short explanation floated beside the content it describes.
//
// Two nouns recur here:
//
// - The **trigger** is the content the tooltip explains — a button, a label,
//   a chart. [`Tooltip`] wraps it: the trigger is declared *inside* the
//   tooltip's area, so pointer and keyboard events over the trigger pass
//   through the tooltip on their way up.
// - The **bubble** is the bordered box holding the tooltip text. It is
//   declared as a *hint layer* — a subtree painted above everything else that
//   takes no input at all (see [`DeclareCtx::hint`]), which is what keeps a
//   tooltip from swallowing the click on the control it describes.

/// takes focus, so wrapping a button in one changes neither its looks nor its
/// keyboard order.
///
/// When [`open`](Self::open) reads `true`, the bubble is declared as a *hint
/// layer*: a subtree painted above everything else that takes no input at all
/// (see [`DeclareCtx::hint`]). A press over the bubble reaches whatever the
/// bubble covers, focus never moves into it, and it dims nothing. That is the
/// whole reason a tooltip can safely float over the control it explains.
///
/// # Who decides when it shows
///
/// Hover, unless the app says otherwise. Bound to nothing, a Tooltip shows its
/// bubble while the pointer rests anywhere inside the trigger and hides it
/// again when the pointer leaves — the runtime owns hover, and
/// [`DeclareCtx::pointer_within`] answers for this declaration while it is
/// being declared, so nothing is stored and no message is routed.
///
/// [`open_when`](Self::open_when) replaces that rule with one of the app's
/// own. The reader receives both app state and the same hover answer, so the
/// two compose:
///
/// - `|_, hovered| hovered` is the default, spelled out.
/// - `|state, hovered| hovered && !state.controls_disabled` gates it.
/// - `|state, hovered| hovered || state.focus.contains_path(["save"])` adds
///   keyboard focus, which the component cannot observe on its own: focus
///   changes are the runtime's messages, not this component's events.
///
/// Whichever decides it, the answer starts with the hover the *previous* frame
/// resolved. The Tooltip also checks the pointer against the trigger's current
/// declaration geometry, so reflow or scrolling that moves the trigger away
/// closes the bubble on that redraw. Other identity changes with no pointer
/// motion — a modal opening over the trigger, for example — can still settle
/// one frame later.
///
/// [`open`](Self::open) is the same reader plus a message, for an app that
/// keeps a flag the Tooltip should change. It asks for two:
///
/// - `on_open_change(true)` when the pointer moves over the trigger while the
///   tooltip is closed.
/// - `on_open_change(false)` on an unmodified Esc, while the tooltip is open
///   and focus is somewhere inside the trigger — the key bubbles out of the
///   focused child to the Tooltip.
///
/// # Placement
///
/// [`side`](Self::side) picks the preferred side and defaults to
/// [`TooltipSide::Top`]. The bubble is centered on the trigger's other axis,
/// and if the preferred side has no room inside
/// [`frame_area`](DeclareCtx::frame_area) it flips to the opposite side; if
/// neither side fits it stays on the preferred one. Either way the bubble is
/// finally clamped inside the frame, so it is always fully visible.
///
/// Width is the text's natural width capped by [`max_width`](Self::max_width)
/// and by the frame; height follows from wrapping the text to that width.
